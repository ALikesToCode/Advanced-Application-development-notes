## What is the Frontend?

### User-Facing Part of an Application

The **frontend** is the part of a web application that users interact with directly. It encompasses:

- **User Interface (UI)**: The visual elements, such as layouts, buttons, text, images, and forms.
- **User Experience (UX)**: The overall experience and satisfaction a user has when interacting with the application.

### Requirements and Desirable Features

**Requirements:**

- **Avoid Complex Logic**: The frontend should be lightweight, delegating complex application logic to the backend.
- **No Data Storage**: Persistent data storage should be managed by the backend.
- **Stateless Interaction**: Work with the stateless nature of HTTP, where each request is independent.

**Desirable Features:**

- **Aesthetically Pleasing**: Visually appealing designs enhance user engagement.
- **Responsive**: Quick load times and smooth interactions without lag.
- **Adaptive**: Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

## Creating a Basic Vue.js Application

### Step 1: Setting Up the HTML Structure

Create a new HTML file named `index.html`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello World Vue App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="app">
        <!-- Vue.js will render content here -->
    </div>

    <!-- Include Vue.js Library -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>
    <!-- Include Your Application Script -->
    <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

- The `<div id="app">` serves as the root element for the Vue instance.
- The Vue.js library is included via a CDN for easy setup.
- The `app.js` script will contain your Vue.js application logic.

### Step 2: Creating the Vue Instance

Create a new JavaScript file named `app.js`.

```javascript
// app.js

// Create a new Vue instance
var app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: {
        message: 'Hello World'
    }
});
```

**Explanation:**

- `el: '#app'`: Binds the Vue instance to the HTML element with `id="app"`.
- `data`: An object containing application data that the Vue instance manages.

### Step 3: Displaying Data in the HTML

Modify the HTML within the `div` to display the message.

```html
<div id="app">
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
</div>
```

**Explanation:**

- `{{ message }}` is an interpolation that binds the `message` data property to the HTML.

### Viewing the Application

Open `index.html` in your web browser. You should see **Hello World** displayed on the page.

---

## Understanding Reactivity in Vue.js

Reactivity is a core concept in Vue.js, allowing the UI to automatically update when the underlying data changes.

### Demonstrating Reactivity

1. Open the browser's developer console.
2. Type the following command to change the `message`:

   ```javascript
   app.message = 'Hello Vue!';
   ```

3. Press Enter.

**Result:** The text displayed on the page updates immediately to **Hello Vue!** without manually modifying the DOM.

### Using Vue Devtools

1. Open the browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting **Inspect**).
2. Navigate to the **Vue** tab.
3. Inspect the root Vue instance and observe the `data` properties.

**Benefits:**

- Real-time inspection and modification of data properties.
- Monitoring of component hierarchies and states.

---

## Event Handling in Vue.js

Vue.js simplifies event handling with the `v-on` directive, allowing you to listen to DOM events and run methods when triggered.

### Adding a Button with an Event Listener

Modify your HTML to include a button:

```html
<div id="app">
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
    <button v-on:click="sayHi">Say Hi</button>
</div>
```

**Explanation:**

- `v-on:click="sayHi"`: Attaches a click event listener to the button, calling the `sayHi` method.

### Defining Methods in the Vue Instance

Update `app.js` to include the `sayHi` method:

```javascript
var app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: {
        message: 'Hello World'
    },
    methods: {
        sayHi: function() {
            this.message = 'Hi!';
        }
    }
});
```

**Explanation:**

- `methods`: An object where you define functions (methods) to handle events.
- `this.message`: Refers to the `message` data property in the Vue instance.

### Testing the Event

1. Reload the page.
2. Click the **Say Hi** button.
3. The displayed message updates to **Hi!**

### Shorthand for Event Handling

Vue.js provides a shorthand for `v-on`:

```html
<button @click="sayHi">Say Hi</button>
```

---

## Conditional Rendering

Conditional rendering allows you to dynamically show or hide elements based on data properties.

### Using v-if and v-else

Modify your HTML to include conditional elements:

```html
<div id="app">
    <p v-if="count === 0">No replies yet.</p>
    <p v-else>Number of replies: {{ count }}</p>
    <button @click="incrementCount">Say Hi</button>
</div>
```

### Updating the Vue Instance

Update `app.js`:

```javascript
var app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: {
        count: 0
    },
    methods: {
        incrementCount: function() {
            this.count++;
        }
    }
});
```

### Testing Conditional Rendering

1. Load the page; it should display **No replies yet.**
2. Click **Say Hi**; it changes to **Number of replies: 1**.

### Using v-else-if

You can handle multiple conditions:

```html
<p v-if="count === 0">No replies yet.</p>
<p v-else-if="count < 5">Number of replies: {{ count }}</p>
<p v-else>You are very popular!</p>
```

**Explanation:**

- The message changes based on the value of `count`.
- When `count` reaches 5 or more, it displays **You are very popular!**

## Two-way Data Binding with v-model

The `v-model` directive creates a two-way data binding between form inputs and the Vue instance's data.

### Binding an Input Field

Modify your HTML to include an input field:

```html
<div id="app">
    <input type="text" v-model="visitorName" placeholder="Your name">
    <button @click="sayHi">Say Hi</button>
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
</div>
```

### Updating the Vue Instance

Add `visitorName` to your data and update the `sayHi` method:

```javascript
var app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: {
        visitorName: '',
        message: ''
    },
    methods: {
        sayHi: function() {
            if (this.visitorName) {
                this.message = this.visitorName + ' says Hi!';
                this.visitorName = ''; // Clear the input
            }
        }
    }
});
```

### Testing Two-way Binding

1. Enter a name in the input field.
2. Click **Say Hi**.
3. The message updates to include the entered name.
4. The input field is cleared after submission.

## List Rendering with v-for

The `v-for` directive is used to render a list of items based on an array.

### Displaying a List of Visitors

#### Updating Data Properties

Add an array to store visitors:

```javascript
data: {
    visitorName: '',
    message: '',
    visitors: []
}
```

#### Modifying the sayHi Method

Update the method to add the visitor to the array:

```javascript
methods: {
    sayHi: function() {
        if (this.visitorName) {
            this.visitors.push(this.visitorName);
            this.message = this.visitorName + ' says Hi!';
            this.visitorName = '';
        }
    }
}
```

#### Updating the HTML

Use `v-for` to display the list:

```html
<ul>
    <li v-for="name in visitors">{{ name }}</li>
</ul>
```

### Testing List Rendering

1. Enter names and click **Say Hi** multiple times.
2. Observe that each name is added to the list below.

---

## Computed Properties

Computed properties are used for values that depend on other data properties. They are cached until their dependencies change.

### Adding a Computed Property

Define a computed property for the visitor count:

```javascript
computed: {
    visitorCount: function() {
        return this.visitors.length;
    }
}
```

### Updating Conditional Rendering to Use Computed Property

Modify your HTML:

```html
<p v-if="visitorCount === 0">No replies yet.</p>
<p v-else-if="visitorCount < 5">Number of replies: {{ visitorCount }}</p>
<p v-else>You are very popular!</p>
```

### Benefits of Computed Properties

- **Efficiency**: Computed properties are only recalculated when their dependencies change.
- **Clarity**: They encapsulate complex logic, making templates cleaner.

## Understanding State in Applications

### State Overview

**State** refers to the stored information that represents the current status of an application or system.

### System State

- **Definition**: The complete set of data maintained by the system.
- **Examples**:
  - Databases of e-commerce sites (product listings, user accounts).
  - News articles on media websites.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Typically large and comprehensive.
  - Independent of the frontend UI.

### Application State

- **Definition**: The state of the application as experienced by an individual user.
- **Includes**:
  - Session data.
  - User preferences.
  - Shopping carts.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Specific to a user or session.
  - Managed on both client and server sides.

### UI State (Ephemeral State)

- **Definition**: The temporary state of the user interface components.
- **Examples**:
  - Open/closed status of a modal.
  - Loading spinners.
  - Currently active tabs.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Short-lived and specific to the current view.
  - Often managed entirely on the client side.

---

## Programming Styles: Imperative vs. Declarative

### Imperative Programming

**Definition**: A programming paradigm that uses statements to change a program's state.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Describes **how** to perform operations.
  - Explicit sequences of commands.
- **Example**:
  - Manually updating the DOM elements step by step.

### Declarative Programming

**Definition**: A programming paradigm that expresses the logic of computation without describing its control flow.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Describes **what** the desired outcome is.
  - Relies on the underlying system to manage the control flow.
- **Example in Vue.js**:
  - Using data binding and directives to declare the desired UI state.

**Benefits of Declarative Programming:**

- **Simpler Code**: Reduces complexity by abstracting away control flow.
- **Maintainability**: Easier to read and understand.
- **Reactivity**: Frameworks like Vue.js handle the synchronization between data and UI.

## Application and UI State Management

### The Stateless Nature of HTTP

- **HTTP Protocol**: Each request-response cycle is independent.
- **Challenge**: Maintaining continuity (state) across multiple requests.

### Conveying State Between Client and Server

#### Client-Side State Management

- **Approach**:
  - State is stored on the client (e.g., in cookies, local storage).
  - The client sends necessary state information with each request.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces server load.
  - Enables offline capabilities.

#### Server-Side State Management

- **Approach**:
  - State is maintained on the server, often using sessions.
  - The client sends a session identifier with each request.
- **Advantages**:
  - Centralized control over state.
  - Enhanced security for sensitive data.

### Example: Tic-Tac-Toe Application

**Scenario:**

- **Game State**: The positions of X's and O's on the grid.
- **UI State**: Highlighting the current player's turn, showing a winning line.
- **Challenges**:
  - Synchronizing game state between players (if multiplayer).
  - Managing UI updates in response to game state changes.

**State Management Strategies:**

- Use Vue.js reactivity to update the UI when the game state changes.
- Employ client-side state for UI interactions and server-side state for game logic and persistence.
